# House Price Prediction Project

# Overview
This project is about predicting house prices based on different factors like the number of rooms, square footage, location, and other house features. The goal is to use machine learning techniques to estimate the selling price of a house as accurately as possible.

If you’ve ever wondered why some houses cost more than others, this project helps break it down with data and numbers!

# Problem Statement
Our task is to predict house sale prices based on various features provided in the dataset. Given a test dataset with house details, we need to estimate the "SalePrice" for each house.

# Dataset
- Training Data: Contains details about houses, such as size, number of rooms, location, and their actual sale prices.
- Test Data: Contains similar details but without sale prices (we need to predict these).
- Data Description: Explains what each column in the dataset means.
- Sample Submission: Shows how our final output should be formatted.

# Steps to Solve the Problem
1. Data Exploration
   - Load the dataset and understand its structure.
   - Identify missing values and outliers.
   - Visualize important features to see trends.

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert categorical features into numerical ones.
   - Normalize/scale numerical data if necessary.

3. Feature Selection
   - Choose the most important features affecting house prices.
   - Remove unnecessary columns to improve model performance.

4. Model Building
   - Try different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
   - Compare their performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² score.

5. Model Tuning & Optimization
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation to check model consistency.

6. Predictions & Submission
   - Use the best-performing model to make final predictions on the test data.
   - Save the results in the required format and submit.

# Evaluation Metrics
The predictions are evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score (Explains how well the model fits the data)

# Conclusion
By following these steps, we build a model that predicts house prices with good accuracy. This project is a great way to apply data science skills and understand real estate pricing dynamics!
